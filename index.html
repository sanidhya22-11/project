<title>My Hobby Is
    Reading Books
</title>

<body>
    <p>I have many friends at school and I love to play with them. In my neighbourhood also there are many children who are my friends. But although I value their friendship a lot, I have another friend who is the dearest of all. That friend is my library.

        I have built a little library of my own at home. Ever since I was born my parents have been collecting books for me. It began with books teaching the alphabet. Then came numbers. Gradually I had books with short stories. My mother used to read them to me at bed time. Now I have fairy tales, folk tales from different parts of the world, fun books, and books on geography, science, history and literature, all of which are presented in the form of a story.

        I love books. On my holidays I pick up any book and get so engrossed in it that I often forget to eat. My mother has to yell at me to have my lunch. At times my friends come over, but if I am busy reading an interesting story I hate to put down my book to play with them
